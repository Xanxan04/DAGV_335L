Animations and Games Lab

Description: An abstract space-like animation I created for one of my cohort's challenge. This was created during Spring 2024 around February or March. We have complete freedom over what we want to create so I went with this random idea that just works when I tried to go into Blender and mess around within it.

Steps: 1. Add camera and define the space in which this animation is going to turn out, or rather, frame the animation
       2. Create all the props and meshes needed for the animation (center, meteor ring, waves, crystal thingy)
       3. Create simple animations for each of the prop (pulse, rotate, zoom, color change, etc)
       4. Combine camera movement to create the first animation draft
       5. Apply and create materials for all of the props and background
       6. Post-process in Blender (composite)
       7. Render

Techniques: Parent animation, shaders, fracture (for the prop)

Challenges: The only challenge was the render time since I'm rendering in Cycles and compositing takes a really long time. It rendered for like 12 hours straight or more. Besides that, nothing else since I know what I'm doing.
