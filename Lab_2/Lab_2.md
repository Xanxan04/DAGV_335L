Description: This is just a rig test to show that I know how to rig in Blender. A simple stickman model with rigs and proper controls, IK, and weights on it.

Steps: 1. Create the simple stickman model, humanoid.
       2. Create a simple rig for the humanoid.
       3. Create the controls and IK using Rigify.
       4. Parent the rig to the mesh with weights.
       5. Test and fix any error

Techniques: Rigify, basic modeling

Challenges: There wasn't any challenge besides aligning the bones to match with the model which makes sense from a rigging standpoint.
