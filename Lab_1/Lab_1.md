Description: This is a model that I made about 1 year ago in a modeling class with Lucas Wild. The task was to create an upgraded version of a studio that we made a
             couple weeks prior. The professor only required to create a more intricate version of our studio but I decided to take this chance to try and create a 
             proper studio with renders and everything.

Steps: 1. Find references
       2. Work on small parts first (Individual tripod, camera, lights, creates, chairs, etc) and their materials
       3. Build the dimension of the room
       4. Add in the camera and frame the scene
       5. Populate the room with objects
       6. Render and post-processing
       7. Finished

Techniques: Additive modeling, cloth simulation, non-destructive modifier modeling.

Challenges: The only real challenge I faced was the amount of details I want to include in the room, which means I had to create a lot of models but it just took
            some time to create them all and the rest of the process was a breeze.

Additional notes: I used Blender's composite and Photoshop to render the final piece. I also used the internet for a couple of textures I used.
